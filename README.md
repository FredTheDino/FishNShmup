# Fish n Ships

Made during LiU Fall Game Jam 2020.

## Building

Requirements:

- [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/)
- [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)

Build and run using the Makefile (`make build` and `make run`)

You can also download a Windows .exe or a pre-compiled .love from the [Github
release](https://github.com/FredTheDino/FishNShmup/releases/tag/gamejam). If you
get the .exe you don't need anything else, but to run the .love you need Löve2D
installed.

## Instructions

Control your ship with WASD. Picking up the fishing rod enters the fishing
minigame which you control with A and D. Keep the bar in the middle to gain
points. If you get 500 points while fishing you get a sick power-up.
